# Install-Jenkins-on-Linux-EC2
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that integrates with a number of AWS Services, such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot, and Amazon EC2 Fleet. You can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to deploy a Jenkins application on AWS in a matter of minutes. This tutorial walks you through the process of deploying a Jenkins application. You will launch an EC2 instance, install Jenkins on that instance, and configure Jenkins to automatically spin up Jenkins build slave instances if build abilities need to be augmented on the instance.
